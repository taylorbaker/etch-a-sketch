Etch-A-Sketch is a simple web app that creates a 'pixelated' grid with dimensions based on user input. Display dimensions can be updated by entering a new value in the input field and clicking 'Create!'. Hovering over a pixel with the mouse will set the pixel backgroundColor to a random hsl value. Display area can be reset by clicing 'Create!'.
